In our paper, we manually translate the English articles of the test sets of Gigaword and DUC2004 into the corresponding Chinese.    
In addition, we also manually translate 2,000 Engligh articles, randomly extracting from validation of Gigaword, into Chinese as the validation set of cross-lingual summarization tasks.


With regard to the Gigaword training set, we are grateful to [srush](https://github.com/srush) for providing the processed corpus. You can get it from [sent-summary](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary).
